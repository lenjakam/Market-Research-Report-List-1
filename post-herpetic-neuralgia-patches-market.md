<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Post Herpetic Neuralgia Patches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lidocaine Skin Patches</li><li>Capsaicin Skin Patches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Post Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) patches market includes two primary types: Lidocaine skin patches and Capsaicin skin patches. Lidocaine patches work by numbing the affected area, providing localized pain relief for PHN sufferers. Capsaicin patches contain capsaicin, derived from chili peppers, which depletes substance P, a neuropeptide associated with pain transmission, leading to reduced pain sensitivity over time. Both types cater to patients seeking non-invasive, topical options to manage chronic pain following herpes zoster infections.</p></p>
