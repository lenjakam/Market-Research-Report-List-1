<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Glucose Test Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase</li><li>Glucose Oxidase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood glucose test paper market primarily includes two types: glucose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase. Glucose dehydrogenase test strips utilize an enzymatic reaction that converts glucose into gluconic acid, producing an electrical signal proportional to glucose levels, offering rapid and accurate results. In contrast, glucose oxidase test strips rely on the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide, requiring a color change to indicate glucose concentration. Both types cater to diabetics for monitoring blood sugar levels effectively.</p></p>
