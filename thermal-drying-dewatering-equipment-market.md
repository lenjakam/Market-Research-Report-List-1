<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Drying Dewatering Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal drying dewatering equipment can be categorized into two primary types: direct and indirect. </p><p>Direct-type systems expose materials directly to hot air or gases, promoting moisture evaporation through direct contact. This method is generally more energy-efficient and faster. </p><p>In contrast, indirect-type systems use heated surfaces to transfer heat, minimizing exposure to the drying medium. This approach is useful for materials sensitive to temperature or contaminants, offering better control but often requiring more time and energy. Both types serve various industrial applications effectively.</p></p>
